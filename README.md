# SoundAnchoring

SoundAnchoring is a system for organizing, visualizing and exploring music collections. The system is based on a modification of the Self-Organizing Map algorithm that allows users to choose the locations of clusters containing acoustically similar tracks on the music space.

This repository lists tracks that were employed in a user study conducted to evaluate SoundAnchoring.
